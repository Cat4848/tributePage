        <h3 id="headline">James Watt's life may be summarised as follows:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>1736</strong> – born on 19 January in Scotland.</li>
            <li> <strong>1753</strong> – went to Glasgow to study mathematics and instruments making.</li>
            <li> <strong>1755</strong> – goes to London to study. This is where he found a master to train him.</li>
            <li> <strong>1757</strong> – returns to Glasgow: he opened a shop at the university and made mathematical instruments (e.g., quadrants, compasses, scales).</li>
            <li> <strong>1764</strong> – he married his cousin Margaret Miller, who, before she died nine years later, bore him six children.</li>
            <li> <strong>1765</strong> – invents the separate condenser, his first and greatest invention. Watt had realized that the loss of latent heat (the heat involved in changing the state of a substance—e.g., solid or liquid) was the worst defect of the Newcomen engine and that therefore condensation must be effected in a chamber distinct from the cylinder but connected to it.</li>
            <li> <strong>1769</strong> – takes out the famous patent for “A New Invented Method of Lessening the Consumption of Steam and Fuel in Fire Engines.”</li>
            <li> <strong>1766</strong> – becomes a land surveyor.</li>
            <li> <strong>1774</strong> – moves to Birmingham, England</li>
            <li> <strong>1775</strong> – begins a 25 years-long business partnership with Matthew Boulton. </li>
            <li> <strong>1776</strong> – two engines were installed: one for pumping water in a Staffordshire colliery, the other for blowing air into the furnaces of British industrialist John Wilkinson.</li>
            <li> <strong>1776</strong> – marries again; his second wife, Ann MacGregor, bore him two more children.</li>
            <li> <strong>1782</strong> – patentes the double-acting engine, in which the piston pushed as well as pulled.</li>
            <li> <strong>1784</strong> – invents the parallel motion: an arrangement of connected rods that guided the piston rod in a perpendicular motion.</li>
            <li> <strong>1785</strong> – elected fellow of the Royal Society of London.</li>

            <li> <strong>1790</strong> – invents the pressure gauge, which virtually completes the Watt engine.</li>
            <li> <strong>1795</strong> – gradually withdraws from business.</li>
            <li> <strong>1806</strong> – he was made doctor of laws of the University of Glasgow. </li>
            <li> <strong>1814</strong> – becomes foreign associate of the French Academy of Sciences.</li>
            <li> <strong>1819</strong> – dies on 25 August (aged 83) in Birmingham, England.</li>

          </ul>
